# Individual Project 4
# Meta-Learning and Few Shot Learning
#### Due Date
* Thursday Apr 29, 2020 (23:59)

#### Total Points
* 100 (One Hundred)

## Goal
In project 2, you were given a bunch of drivers and their trajectories to build a model to classify which driver a given trajectory belongs to. In this project, we will give you a harder task. In project 2, the training data contain 5 drivers and 6-month trajectories for each driver. In this task, however, the trainning data contain 500 drivers and only 5-day trajectories for each driver. In this task, you should use meta-learning and/or few shot learning to build the classification model. The model for each driver can be a binary classification, which takes two trajectories as input and predict whether these two trajectories belongs to the same driver. 

## Current Leaderboard

## Evaluation
To evaluation your submission, a seperate test dataset will be held. For each driver, the test data will contains 10 different trajectories. We will randomly generate 20,000 trajectory pairs and use them to evaluate your submitted model. Like project 2, you should submit a evaluation.py file containing how to process the model and how to run prediction.

## Project Guidelines

#### Dataset Description
The data is binary pickled file. The data is stored in a dictionary, in which the key is ID of a driver and value is list of his/her trajectories. For each trajectory, the basic element is similar to project 2. Each element in the trajectory is in the following format, [ plate, longitude, latitude, second_since_midnight, status, time ]. Data can be found at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aHGJx2KtzjCRlfPYefPaGPl3e5lyJTX-/view?usp=sharing). The training data contain **500** drivers and **5**-day trajectories for each driver.
#### Feature Description 
* **Plate**: Plate means the taxi's plate. In this project, we change them to 0~500 to keep anonymity. Same plate means same driver, so this is the target label for the classification. 
* **Longitude**: The longitude of the taxi.
* **Latitude**: The latitude of the taxi.
* **Second_since_midnight**: How many seconds has past since midnight.
* **Status**: 1 means taxi is occupied and 0 means a vacant taxi.
* **Time**: Timestamp of the record.

#### Problem Definition
Given two full-day trajectories,  you need to predict whether those two given trajectories belongs to the same driver. 

#### Evaluation 
Two days of trajectories will be used to evaluate your submission. And test trajectories are not in the data/ folder. However, we have provided a validation dataset. The validate_set.pkl contains validation data and validate_label.pkl contains labels. You can construct your own validation set based on the trajectories and their corresponding labels. Same as usual, you can use pickle.load() function to load the dataset and evaluate your model. 
##### Feature Description of validation data
* **Longitude**: The longitude of the taxi.
* **Latitude**: The latitude of the taxi.
* **Second_since_midnight**: How many seconds has past since midnight.
* **Status**: 1 means taxi is occupied and 0 means a vacant taxi.
* **Time**: Timestamp of the record.

#### Submission Guideline
To help better and fast evaluate your model, please submit a separate python file named "evaluation.py". This file should contain two functions.
* **Data Processing**
  ```python
  def processs_data(traj_1, traj_2):
    """
    Input:
        Traj: a list of list, contains one trajectory for one driver 
        example:[[114.10437, 22.573433, '2016-07-02 00:08:45', 1],
           [114.179665, 22.558701, '2016-07-02 00:08:52', 1]]
    Output:
        Data: any format that can be consumed by your model.
    
    """
    return data
  ```
* **Model Prediction**
    ```python
    def run(data, model):
        """
        
        Input:
            Data: the output of process_data function.
            Model: your model.
        Output:
            prediction: the predicted label(plate) of the data, an int value.
        
        """
        return prediction
  ```
